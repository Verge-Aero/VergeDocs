# Verge App Toolbox

The Verge App Toolbox provides a centralized way to install, update, and delete Verge's desktop software. The latest version of the toolbox can be downloaded at any time from our [downloads page](https://aeroportal.droneshow.software/downloads).

After logging in, you will be presented with a list of Apps on the left hand side, as well as a list of streams for those apps whose availability is dictated by your [desktop permissions](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Oh6nX1fqlJti7A6kJdwJ/s/akGR2bVCZLTNoe2hkqeR/~/changes/15/drone-show-software/verge-web-portal/managing-users-desktop-permissions).

The toolbox allows you to install, uninstall, and update our desktop software from any stream you have permissions to.&#x20;

If the version you have installed is out of date, you will be prompted to update to the latest version. Updates to the toolbox itself are automatic and will prompt you to restart the application when they are available.
