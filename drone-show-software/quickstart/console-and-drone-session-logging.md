# Console & Drone Session Logging

After the console exits show mode, session logs will be finalized that can then be uploaded via the Verge App Toolbox. Check back in periodically to see if you have pending session logs to upload. After uploading, these will be available to analyze in the web portal via the Session Log Analysis page.
