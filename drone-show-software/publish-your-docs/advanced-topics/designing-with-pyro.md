# Designing With Pyro

The Verge Design Studio contains fully-integrated tools to design, visualize, and validate shows with pyro drones.

## Defining Pyro And Mounting



## Cue Triggers

To trigger a pyro cue, a drone must be tracking a slot with a&#x20;

#### Sequential Trigger

#### Simultaneous Trigger





## Pre-viz



#### Supported Products

A small subset of VDL options are currently supported for native visualization and will expand over time.

To visualize other products, the show must be exported and opened in supported pyro previz software such as Finale3D or FWsim

## Pointing Pyro

Pyro mounts will obey drone [yaw control](yaw-control.md) and display guiding arrows to provide feedback during the design process.&#x20;

Any performance can be exported to Verge Aero's standard [VVIZ format](../vviz-format.md). This format provides support for LED and pyro drone performances. When imported into Finale3D, the following details are carried over:

* Pyro product VDL
* Pyro mount direction
* Drone Heading
* Drone Position
* LED Color

## FWsim Support
