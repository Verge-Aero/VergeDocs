# Verge Aero Account

All Verge Aero software products require a login to take full advantage of their functionality. A Verge Aero account will allow usage of the Web Portal, [Cloud Asset Repository](../verge-design-studio/show-effects/show-effect-asset-repository.md), App Toolbox, Console Analytics, and much more. If you do not have a Verge Aero Account, you may register at the [web portal](./). Please note that you must currently be a member of, or invited to, an organization that has an active software license.
