# Performance Summaries & Session Log Analysis

Session Log analysis allows you to view performance summaries and indepth analysis of your drone shows. Session logs can be [uploaded](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Oh6nX1fqlJti7A6kJdwJ/s/akGR2bVCZLTNoe2hkqeR/~/changes/15/drone-show-software/quickstart/console-and-drone-session-logging) via opening the Verge App Toolbox after exiting Show Mode from a successful flight in the Console. See instructions [here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Oh6nX1fqlJti7A6kJdwJ/s/akGR2bVCZLTNoe2hkqeR/~/changes/15/drone-show-software/quickstart/console-and-drone-session-logging) if that's unclear.&#x20;

To view session logs after they've been uploaded, enter your organization via the left-hand navbar, then click on the "Session Log Analysis" tab.&#x20;
