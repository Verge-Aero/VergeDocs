# Autopilot

### What is an Autopilot?

In the simplest terms, an autopilot is a software package that is responsible for taking in a bunch of data about a robot's position/rotation in space and ultimately outputting signals to its motors to move through that space. Most autopilots are not limited to quadrotors. They can support other air-based devices (such as fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and blimbs) and even ground or water vehicles like rovers, boats, and submarines.

### Popular Autopilots

#### [PX4](px4.md)

This is the autopilot that Verge Aero uses in both the [X1](../../drone-show-hardware/drones/x1.md) and [X7](../../drone-show-hardware/drones/x7.md). It is an open source project that is built on top of the RTOS [NuttX](https://wiki.droneshow.software/index.php?title=NuttX\&action=edit\&redlink=1).
